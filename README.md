# Summary

The UD Xibe Treebank is a corpus of the Xibe language (ISO 639-3: *sjo*) containing manually annotated syntactic trees under the Universal Dependencies. Sentences come from three sources: grammar book examples, newspaper (Cabcal News) and Xibe textbooks. 

# Introduction

UD Xibe treebank is developed with the UD framework. It includes grammar book examples from *General Introduction to Xibe Grammar* (*sibe gisun i gisun kooli i hafupi leolen*,*锡伯语语法通论*) by Setuken (佘吐肯), and newspaper sentences from *Cabcal News*.
